# Behavioral Cloning Project (Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree)

The following project represents my solution the Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Behavioral Clonning Project. 

# OverView

The project will take data collected from a car simulator and it will be used to train, evaluate and test the model.
The data consist in a series of images from the road taken from the center of the car, left and right and a csv file. 
The CSV file has data about the steering wheel angle corresponding to each image. 

Note: The simulator is a toold developed by Udacity and it is not contained in this Repo. Also for obvious reasons the folder
data2 mentioned in the model.py file is not contained either.
